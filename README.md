# Snake.hs
This is a snake game that I wrote in order to get a basic grasp of using monad transformers, threads, and the terminal in Haskell.

As of now the major mechanics are missing besides basic movement and input but I hope to have the game running smoothly soon. Eventual plans include using a graphics library to bring the game out of the terminal.
